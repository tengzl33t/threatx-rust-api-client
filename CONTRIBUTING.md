## Bug reports

A bug is a verifiable issue that is caused by the code in the repository.
Clear and detailed bug reports are extremely valuable.

### Guideline:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported
   in [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/tengzl33t/threatx-rust-api-client/issues).
2. Check if the case is still actual and is reproducible using the latest main branch.
3. Isolate the problem and provide list of actions required to reproduce problematic behaviour.
4. Open the issue ticket with all the findings.

A good bug report should provide all the necessary information upfront,
so others don’t need to follow up for clarification.
Please try to include as many details as possible in your report.

#### Report example:

> Short and descriptive title
>
> A summary If possible, include the steps required to reproduce the issue.
>
> 1. First step
> 2. Second step
> 3. Etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are highly appreciated.
Please ensure your suggestions align with the project's goals and provide enough details
and context to support its value.

To open a feature request, create a new issue ticket with label 'enhancement'
in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tengzl33t/threatx-rust-api-client/issues).
Before opening a new FR, please if this has already been reported.

## Pull requests

A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.
In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes
before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.

All the commits pushed must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification.

### Code style requirements:

- Code must pass all the pytest and ruff checks before being merged to the main branch.
- Make sure unit tests cover all the new code pieces (functions, variables, etc).
- Reuse code as much as possible, ensure there are no duplicates if possible. Do not "reinvent the bicycle".
- No AI generated code is allowed.

### Guideline:

1. Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:tengzl33t/threatx-rust-api-client.git`
2. Create a new branch for the pull request: `git checkout -b branch_name`
3. Make required changes, commit and push.
4. Open a PR in GitHub with appropriate labels, title and description.

Please check [this guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide), if you are new to the git.
